YX : YARQUEN JAM : DO NOT DRINK DURING XMAS
===========================================

> Santa's Reindeers have gone crazy and stole his presents and booze! Get on your beetle, recover them presents, avoid trees and, most important, **DO NOT DRINK!!!**

To fight the horde of zombie grapes his only weapons are his own seeds, but he has to spin really fast to throw'em on to cause enough damage. The downside of this is that he doesn't have control on the direction of his projectiles!
